# 🏥 Aged Care Management System

**Course:** ICT30017 – Project Options  
**Project Type:** Software Engineering Project  

This project is a **management system for aged care service providers**, built with **TypeScript, React, Vite, and Chakra UI**.  
It aims to improve the quality of life for elderly people while streamlining tasks for carers and administrative staff.

## 📖 Overview

Due to cognitive decline with age, many elderly people need help and support for their daily activities. Some can manage with **in-home care**, while others require **residential care** facilities with 24/7 support.  

Currently, aged care services often rely on separate, disconnected software for tasks like billing, scheduling, or inventory.  
This project brings these features into a **single integrated platform** for better efficiency.

## ✨ Features

- **Member Management** – records elderly residents' personal details, care plans, medications, and family contacts.  
- **Staff Management** – staff profiles with roles, qualifications, employment type, and payroll details.
